# HRM

Our model uses existing High Resolution Melt (HRM) data to predict HRM profiles for pathogens that had not yet been sequenced. We have previously demonstrated experimentally and with a naive learning algorithm that HRM data can achieve faster and more accurate pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing [1]. Presently, we aim to address the limited availability of complete reference genomes for pathogenic bacteria. A rich database, such as one generated by our model, would enable more rapid and accurate diagnoses of sepsis. Here, we present our model, built upon a conditional generative adversarial net.
